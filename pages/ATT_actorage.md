## Does age matter?
As previously seen, female actors tend to be younger than male actors. Let us see if it has as effect on revenue and rating.

In the blue graph in regard to revenue, actor age also doesn't correlate with how audiences rate a film. The relationship is negligibly negative, meaning actor age doesn't really affect the average voting score of a movie.

Moreover, the revenue graph shows that there's practically no connection between the ages of actors and how much money a movie makes. The correlation is very small, so age isn't a good predictor of a film's financial success.
