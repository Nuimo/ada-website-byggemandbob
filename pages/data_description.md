## Dataset Description
Before starting to analyse the data, it is important to actually understand what each column name represents and what the importance of it is. Here we are going to create a table that gives a nice overview of the different columns name.
Importantly we are only going to mention the significant ones and the ones that need some explanation - the full list can be found below by toggling the collapsible section.
