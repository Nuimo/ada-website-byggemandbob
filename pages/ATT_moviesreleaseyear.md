LINEAR PLOT GRAPH

#### Rating

The trend line shows a minor decline in TMDB vote average over time with an R-squared of 0.022, indicating the year of release explains only 2.2% of the variance in ratings.

#### Revenue

The upward trend line suggests a slight increase in log-transformed movie box office revenue over the years, with an R-squared of 0.026, meaning the release year accounts for 2.6% of the revenue variance.

All in all the release year is not the best predictor.
