## Is release year magic key?
Let's now take a look at the release year and how it might be able to help us!

The trend line shows a minor decline in TMDB vote average over time with an R-squared of 0.02, indicating the year of release explains only 2.2% of the variance in ratings.
Furthermore, in regard to revenue the upward trend line suggests a slight increase in log-transformed movie box office revenue over the years, with an R-squared of 0.02, meaning the release year accounts for 2.6% of the revenue variance.

All in all the release year is not the best predictor - let's keep going!
