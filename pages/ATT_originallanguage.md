## How about the original language of a movie?

It comes as no surprise, that most movies are in English. But does that mean the movie will get a higher revenue or rating? We divide the the dataset into movie with English as the original language, and movies with non-English as the original language.

When performing linear regression, we see that both revenue and rating has a significant effect - but in the opposite direction!

The plot above shows, that English-spoken movies tend to have a higher revenue, but lower rating.
