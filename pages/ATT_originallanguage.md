## How does the movieâ€™s original language affect the revenue and rating?

It comes as no surprise, that most movies are in English. But does that mean the movie will get a higher revenue or rating? We divide the the dataset into movie with English as the original language, and movies with non-english as the original language.

When performing linear regression, we see that both revenue and rating has a significant effect - but in the opposite direction!
