# Data cleaning

Taking a first look at the data set, we see that only around 10% of the movies have a box office revenue entry. Therefore we enrich the data set with TMDB data (<mark>kilde</mark>). The TMDB data gives us new attributes like revenue, original movie language and movie ranking, that might be interesting for out analysis. After enriching the data, <mark>hvor meget??</mark>% of the movies have a box office revenue entry.

## Distribution of data

Before diving into the data, it needs to be cleaned. Some of the movies have a runtime of 10 hours, or an actor with the height of 3 meters. All of these unrealistic attributes is removed, before continuing with the data. The figures below show the distribution of the numerical variables in the two dataset.

It is clear to see, that there are some extreme outliers in both datasets. Some are the variables also look very heavy-tailed and might need to be transformed.

After removing outliers, the distribution are as shown below.

Looking at the box plot, we notice that **Movie box office revenue** has a very skewed distribution. The left histogram below shows, that very few movies have a very high revenue, and a lot of movie have a much lower revenue. Therefore we transform this variable to make it normal distributed, as shown on the right. <mark>er det relevant?</mark>

However, the value of the US dollar is not the same in 2023 as it was over a hundred years ago. The plot below shows the increase of revenue and value of the US dollar through the years Therefore we will have to <mark>tage h√∏jde for </mark> inflation.
