### Bag-of-words 
- preprocessing, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, 
- We then proceeded to use a TF-IDF
- component reduction, dimensionality reduction, how many components you need, 95%.
- Kmeans, then proceeded find the optimal k, based on the silhouette score and CPU score, ended with k=30. 30 clusters
- (above 1 small block)
- sorted out the cluster with less than 100 samples, we then ended up with 26 clusters.

### Rating & Box Office
- We ended up with the rating being x (IMG)
- and the revenue being (IMG)
- together they form X.

- Confidence intervals don't overlap it is clear that the clusters have significantly different revenues and ratings.

- We then take a look at the three best, three worst, 
- wordclouds
- perhaps a 3x2 of the movie posters from chatGPT.
- wordcloud next to generate movie poster image.

- (maybe make a combination, which movie should you make to have a high revenue and rating)
