## Movie runtime: is it all about the length?
Let's start by taking a look at if movie runtime has any effect on the revenue or rating!

Looking at the plot above most movies are around 100 minutes and has a revenue of 1 million US dollars.

**Rating**: 
The regression line on the scatter plot reveals a modest positive correlation between movie runtime and rating, although the low R-squared value of 0.073 from the liner regression results suggests that runtime is a weak predictor of a movie's rating.

**Revenue**:
Again the regression lien suggests a modest positive correlation between runtime and revenue, but the R-squared value of 0.048 suggest that it is a weak predictor.
