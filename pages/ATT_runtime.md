## Runtime
Let's start by taking a look at if movie runtime has any effect on the revenue or rating! 

![Movie runtime and Log Balanced Movie Box Office Revenue](figures/runtime/movie_runtimeVSlogbalanced_movieboxofficerevenue.png){:width="80%"}
Looking at the plot above most movies are around 100 minutes and has a revenue of 10^6.

LINEAR MODEL GRAPH

Revenue is blue on the left and rating is orange on the right.

Rating: 
The regression line on the scatter plot reveals a modest positive correlation between movie runtime and TMDB vote average, although the low R-squared value of 0.073 from the OLS results suggests that runtime is a weak predictor of a movie's rating.

Revenue: (log_movie_revenue)
Again the regression lien suggests a modest positive correlation between runtime and revenue, but the R-squared value of 0.048 suggest that it is a weak predictor.
